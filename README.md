## Diustou-Arduino-Nano-Clone

This is a project where I took a Diustou Arduino Nano development Board and cloned it in schematic. 
The PCB layout files will be here in the future. 

This is my first PCB clone project so I'm unsure about some components' connections. Feel free to contact kevinxianzhi@gmail.com or xbi3@uw.edu if anything looks suspicious!
